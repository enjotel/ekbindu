\begin{tlate}
Homage to Śrī Gaṇeśa. Now the methods of Rājayoga are laid down. This is the result of Rājayoga\footnote{This statement seems unconnected to the definition of rājayoga that follows.}: Rājayoga is that by which longterm durability of the body arises even amongst manifold royal pleasures even amongst the manifold royal entertainments and spectacle. This truly is Rājayoga. These are the varieties of this Rājayoga:
\noindent 1. Kriyāyoga, the Yoga of [mental] action; 2. Jñānayoga, the Yoga of knowledge; 3. Caryāyoga, the Yoga of wandering;\footnote{The first three Yogas allude to the four \textit{pāda}s of the Śaiva \textit{āgama}s; namely \textit{kriyā[pāda], caryā[pāda], yoga[padā]} and \textit{jñāna[pāda]}.\parencite[77]{nishvasa2015}.} 4. Haṭhayoga, the Yoga of force; 5. Karmayoga, the Yoga of deeds; 6. Layayoga, the Yoga of absorption; 7. Dhyānayoga, the Yoga of meditation, 8.Mantrayoga, the Yoga of Mantras; 9. Lakṣyayoga, the Yoga of fixation objects, 10. Vāsanāyoga, Yoga of mental residues; 11. Śivayoga, the Yoga of Śiva, 12. Brahmayoga, the Yoga of Brahman; 13. Advaitayoga, the Yoga of non-duality; 14. Siddhayoga, the Yoga of the Siddhas; 15. Rājayoga, the King of Yogas. These are the fifteen \textit{yoga}s.\footnote{At the current stage of research it is not clear if this list is a later addition by another scribe or, if indeed it originally stems from Rāmacandra. The list suggests a text following the order of yogas according to this list. However, the order of the yogas given in the list is not followed closely in the text.}

Now the characteristic of Kriyāyoga, the Yoga of [mental] action\footnote{In comparison to the Pātañjalean variant of Kriyāyoga, this variat consists of specific mental actions.} are described.
\paragraph{1.} This Yoga is liberation through [mental] action, it bestows success(\textit{siddhi}) in ones own body. Each wave the mind creates at the beginning of an action, of all those one shall withdraw oneself. Then Kriyāyoga ari
\paragraph{2.} Patience, discrimination, equanimity, peace, modesty, desireless: The Yogī who is endowed with these means is said to be a Kriyāyogī. 
\paragraph{3.} Envy, selfishness, cheating, violence, desire and intoxication, pride, lust, anger, fear, laziness, greed, error and impurity. 
\paragraph{4.} Attachment and aversion, indignation and idleness, impatience and dizzyness: Whoever doesn't experience these is called a Kriyāyogī.\footnote{The source of the four verses on Kriyāyoga is unknown.} \bigskip \bigskip

Patience, discrimination, equanimity, peace, contentment etc. are generated in his mind. He alone is called a Yogī of many actions (\textit{bahukriyāyogī})\footnote{The term \textit{bahukriyāyogī} seems to be unique in yoga literature.} Fraud, illusion, property,violence, craving, envy, ego, anger, anxiety, shame, greed, error, impurity, attachment, aversion, idleness, heterodoxy, false view, affection of the senses, sexual desire: He who diminishes these from day to day in is mind, he alone is called a Yogī of many actions (\textit{bahukriyāyogī}).

    \centerline{\textrm{\small{[Varieties of \textit{rājayoga}: Siddhakuṇḍalinīyoga and Mantrayoga]}}}
    \bigskip
    \begin{tlate}
      Now varieties of Rājayoga will be described. Which are these? One is Siddhakuṇḍalinīyoga\footnote{On the one hand it suprises that we find the term Siddhakuṇḍalinīyoga instead of Siddhayoga as given in the initial list, on the other hand it is suprising that this type of Yoga, given as the second last item in the Yoga taxnomy is introduced as the second type right after Kriyāyoga, which was the first item in the initial list as well as in the following material.What makes this term even more strange is the fact that \textit{kuṇḍaliṇī} is not mentioned at all in the following description of this type of Yoga.} [and one\footnote{It is not entirely clear if those are two different Yogas or one and the same type of Yoga. Just the pretty late witness U2 gives us a sort of description of Mantrayoga. Judging on the basis of U2 only one could translate ``One is Siddhakuṇḍalinīyoga being Mantrayoga.'' Judging by the contents given by the rest of the witnesses this passage leaves a big queastion mark.}] is Mantrayoga\footnote{It seems odd that Mantrayoga is mentioned in the same breath as Sidhdakuṇḍalinīyoga, even though it is not directly expressed in the following. Just the additional descriptions of witness U2, highlighted in a different colour than the main text, indirectly refers to a certain practice of Mantra which is \textit{japājapa} of the \textit{so 'haṃ} for a certain duration of the practioce of meditation that is presrcibed to be performed on every \textit{cakra}.}. These two Rājayogas are described [in the following]. At the location of the root-bulb exists one major vessel in the form of energy. This single vessel reaches to these openings which are \textit{iḍā}, \textit{piṅgalā} and \textit{suṣumnā}. On the left side is the \textit{iḍā}-channel, being a resemblence of the moon. On the right side exists the \textit{piṅgalā}-channel, being a resemblence of the sun. Within the middle path is a lotuspond being very subtle. [It is] made from a web of light [and it] shines like a thousand lightnings. She \extra{emerges as the central channel, assuming the form of benevolence (\textit{śiva}),} is the bestower of enjoyment and liberation. While abiding in (\textit{satyāṃ}) her (\textit{asyāṃ}) knowledge arises [to the point of which] the person becomes all-knowing.

    \centerline{\textrm{\small{[Description of the first Cakra]}}}
    \bigskip
    \begin{tlate}
      The means for the genesis of knowledge in the central channel will now be described. At the beginning\footnote{Supposedly at the beginning of the central channel.} exists the root \textit{cakra} having four petals. \extra{The first \textit{cakra} of support (\textit{ādhāra}) is at the anus [and] is red-colored. Gaṇeśa is the deity. He is success, intelligence and power. A rat is the mount. The Ṛṣi is Kūrma. The seal is contraction. The vitalwind is \textit{apāna}. The \textit{kalā} is the ``wave of consciousness'' (\textit{urmī}). The concentration is ``she who is powerful'' (\textit{ojasvinī}). In the four petals [of it resides] \textit{rajas}, \textit{sattva}, \textit{tamas} and the mind-faculties (\textit{manāṃsi}), [symbolized by the syllables or \textit{bīja}s] vaṃ śaṃ ṣaṃ and saṃ. A trident is situated in the middle of the triangle\footnote{This passage is odd since a triagle wasn't mentioned before.}.} In the middle is a trident, and \textit{kāmapīṭha}\footnote{Discuss the term \textit{kāmapīṭha}.} in the shape of a triangle. In the middle of this seat (\textit{pīṭha}) exists a single form in the shape of a flame. By meditating on this form the whole literature, all \textit{śāstra}s, all poems, dramas etc., everything [related to] elocution, appears in the mind of the person without learning. \extra{[Assigned to it] is external bliss\footnote{Discuss the four blisses.}, yogic bliss, heroic bliss [and] the bliss of coming to rest.}\footnote{It is noteworthy that only the first \textit{cakra} adds a detailled description of mounts, Ṛṣis, gods, seals and so forth among the current majority of witnesses at hand: E, P, L and U2. All other descriptions of the remaining eight \textit{cakra}s leave this out. The only exception is U2, a relatively late witness that adds similar descriptions for the other \textit{cakra}s as well. Since they are interesting for the history of the text I have added them to the edition's text. To indicate the extra status of those passages I have highlighted them in blue color.} An [over] hundredfold recitation of the non-recited [śataḥ = \ldots hundreds of?];  600 [repetitions for]; 9 \textit{ghaṭi}s [and] 40 \textit{palā}s.\footnote{Instructions for the duration of practice are found in all additions of U2 for each \textit{cakra}. It's not entirely clear if either the duration of meditation on the respective cakra, or the duration for the items in the list being visualised by the practitioner are meant here. However, to it seems to be done for the duration of 600 \textit{ajapājapa}, the ritualized repetition of the \textit{ajapā}, which is the voiceless uttering of the ``natural'' \textit{mantra} of the breath: \textit{so 'haṃ} - \textit{haṃ sa}. I suppose this means the practice is to be done for 600 in- and exhalations. The following part of the entry, namely ``\textit{ghaṭi} 9 \textit{palāni} 40'', probably refers to the exact time in which those 600 \textit{ajapājapa}s shall be performed. One \textit{ghaṭi} equals 1/60 of a day, which is 24 minutes. One \textit{pala} equals 1/60 of a \textit{ghaṭi} which is 24 seconds. This would equal 232 minutes or 3 hours and 52 minutes. Dividing the 600 \textit{ajapājapa}s by 232 minutes, this would result in a very slow frequence of breath of 2,586206897 in- and exhalations per minute.}

    \bigskip
    \begin{tlate}
Now the divisions/differentiations of the ninth cakra are explained. The designation of it is ``the \textit{cakra} of the great void''. Above that there is no other. Therefore it is declared to be the \textit{cakra} of the great perfection. [Another] such name of it is ``(divine) seat of Pūrṇagiri''. In the middle of the \textit{mahāśūnyacakra} exists one lotus facing upward, very red in colour, with a thousand petals - an abode of brilliance and wholeness, whose fragrance is not in range of mind and speech. In the middle of this lotus exists one pericarp having the shape of a triangle. In the middle of the pericarp exists one seventeenth digit in the shape of a immaculé form. A light of the part exists shining like a thousand suns. [But] excessive heat is not arising. Shining like a thousand moons, excess of cold is not arising. \extra{Here at this location the ``I''(\textit{aham}) is the deity. The ``he is I'' (\textit{so 'ham}) is the power. This self is the Ṛṣi. The path is liberation. Brahma is the I above. ``I'm a circle''. In fire-area is the letter "sa". [There?] life arises, the living soul ascends and decends. The place is the hidden place of being. The colour is yellow. The light is the shine of ten million suns. The shine is always and visible. Śiva is the deity. The power is primordial illusion. The state is the dissolution of the self into Hara\footnote{Epiphet of Śiva.}. The transcendental sound has the nature of a sound with stable resonance. The seal is the ``fearless''. The illusion is the root. The body is the original matter. The range is speech and mind. Without delusion, without doubt, the unaffected and undefiled goal is dissolution, meditation [and] final absorption.} Above that is the place of infinite supreme bliss. There above is power (\textit{śakti}). Being designated as such she is one single digit. Due to the exercise of meditation on this part the person manifests whatever he wishes for. He is furnished with royal pleasure and enjoyment. [Even] amusing oneself amongst women, and watching musical pleasures, the \textit{kāla} of the person grows daily like the \textit{kalā} of the moon in the bright half of the month. His body is not affected by merit and sin. Due to uninterrupted meditation the power of the light of the innate nature arises. He sees remotely located objects as if they'd be near.

At first the upward directed fixation (\textit{ūrdhvalakṣya}) is explained. The gaze (\textit{dṛṣṭi}) [should be] in the middle of the sky. And then having caused the mind to be directed upwards, it is caused to be fixed there. Due to the exercise of stabilizing of this fixation (\textit{lakṣya}) arises unity of the gazing point (\textit{dṛṣṭi}) with the light of the highest lord (\textit{parameśvara}). And then an indefinable invisible object arises in the middle of the sky. It arises in the range of sight of the practitioner. This is truly the upward directed fixation (\textit{ūrdhvalakṣya}).

He dwells on earth having pervaded [it]. Birth and death both don't exist. Happiness does'nt exist. Suffering does'nt exist. Impediment does'nt exist. Habit doesn't exist. Place does'nt exist. The manifestation of permanent perception of the connection with god arises in the middle of the mind of this accomplished one. And he is shining - not cold, and not hot, not white [and] not yellow. Neither is there birth of him, nor does he have any attributes. And he is without parts, immacule and uncharacterized. His desire etc. doesn't arise in [situations of] lust [and] is not located within the duality of the result. He attains expanded enjoyment. However, his mind does not suffer attachment in this very state.

Even due to loss suffering does'nt arise in the mind. And then desire doesn't arise. And then with regards to an object that has been obtained for whatever reason towards ones object aversion does'nt arise. With regard to this object affection of the mind does'nt arise. Just this is said to be Rājayoga. And then his mind which knows the sacred speech is equal towards a person, friend and enemy. And a neutral view arises. In the mind of one who is entirely situated in the middle of the earth, the pride of authorship does't arise, because of death and rebirth, and because of happiness and enjoyment. Wile wandering the world he doesn't whish to know authorship. This is also said to be Rājayoga. New durable clothes made of silk, or however, old, worn [clothes] with holes smeared with sandalwood and musk, or smeared with mud. In whose mind joy and sorrow are not situated, just he is [in the state of] Rājayoga.

  \paragraph{1.} He shall see the world truly as being one, shining in all selves. By applying indistinctness he shall accomplish \textit{Jñānayoga}.
  \paragraph{2.} Wherever the world is established or made of omniscience, who knows thus by means of insight, he is a like an expert of knowledge.
  \paragraph{3.} He always attains the reality of \textit{śāmbhavī} - the goal of eternal non-duality. Just as the seed of the Nyagrodha\footnote{In rituals, the nyagrodha (Ficus indica or India fig or banyan tree) danda, or staff, is assigned to the kshatriya class, along with a mantra, intended to impart physical vitality or 'ojas'.27. Brian K. Smith. Reflections on Resemblance, Ritual, and Religion, Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1998} scattered onto the soil [always] becomes a tree.
  \paragraph{4.} The absolute unity (\textit{ekāntaṃ}), is seen as multibel (namely) made up of ten parts by oneself. The rolled up shoots of the branches are the sprouting stalks of the root shoot.
  \paragraph{5.} By virtue of its inherent nature, this branch with its branches, which is the fruit of the flower of love, is in the seed. Certainly, that is pure, eternal, unchanging and immaculate. 
  \paragraph{6.} One, not one and self-existing, existing in manifold ways through its own rule and work, [as] five principles (\textit{tattva}) which are: thinking mind (\textit{manas}), intellect (\textit{buddhi}), illusion (\textit{māya}), individuation (\textit{ahaṃkāra}) and modifications (\textit{vikriyā}).
  \paragraph{7.}In this way, the ten variations fully permeate the world and the non-world. Only one thing is and not something else: Whoever knows this is a connoisseur of reality.
  
   Transmigration is the appearance of the plant world, mountains, trees, earth etc. Transmigration is the appearance of living beings beginning with birds, horses, elephants and humans. And then whoever is one who is a [sense] object of sight is said to be visible. He who is not seen by sight is said to be invisible. In this way the view of separation of one's own self which is subjected to transmigration is to be removed by means of [applying the view of] unity. Only this is Jñānayoga. Because of the execution of it, time does'nt destroy the body.

\begin{tlate}    
  Now the division of the inherent nature is described.\footnote{This refers to the mention of \textit{svabhāva} in verse 5 of the description of Jñānayoga.} Just as the seed of the banyan tree ripens into the shape of the banyan tree, and by its own inherent nature attains such a tenfold division. [Namely]: "Root, shoot, bark, branch, twig, bud, the unfolding flower, flower, fruit and nectar." The division reaches [those] ten parts. In this way, the pure, unchanging, unblemished, attains such [division] precisely because of the inherent nature of the self. [Namely] the division "Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, Mind, Intellect, Illusion, Transformations and Form". Because of the power of Jñānayoga, there arises the certainty that "The Self is verily one." As some particular soil (\textit{ekaika}) sometimes appears soft, sometimes beautiful, sometimes fragrant, sometimes unscented, sometimes golden, sometimes silver, is sometimes made of precious stone, sometimes appearing white, sometimes black, sometimes copper, sometimes yellow, sometimes mottled, sometimes like various fruit, sometimes like flowers, sometimes like the nectar of immortality, [and that only] because of its inherent nature. In this way, the self also takes the form of a human, a bird, a gazelle, an elephant, a vidyādhara, a gandharva, a centaur, great scholar or a great fool, a sick or healthy, an angry or or peaceful person, by virtue of its inherent nature. Because of Jñānayoga, transformation is recognized as formless, Just as the place of origin of the fruit is only one. But the transformation of the fruit is seen as manifold.
  
  One fruit falls onto the ground. It is getting bright. A bee drinks the flower juice of a fruit. The lover [bee] places itself on the flower wreath above the protuberant circular pistil. A bee drinks the juice of a fruit. The lover (bee) places herself on the flower wreath above the upstanding circular pistil. ne fruit throws the nectar over the flower. This is the inherent nature of the matter. In the same way also the one self enjoys the eight pleasures because of its own being.  
\\ \\
What are the eight enjoyments?  \hfill \break
A beautiful dwelling, good clothing, a good bed, a well-trained horse?, a nice place, food and drink.\footnote{The verse only gives 7 enjoyments!} Those are the eight enjoyments of the wise.
\\ \\
  1. Clothes made from silk; \hfill \break
  2. A site of the palace in which there are mainsions endowned with five or seven rooms.\hfill \break
  3. A huge, very soft and lovely bed; \hfill \break
  4. [on which] there is seated a lotus-like youthful, charming and virtuous wife;\hfill \break 
  5. An excellent throne;\hfill \break
  6. An exceptional valuable horse; \hfill \break
  7. Food that pleases the senses; \hfill \break
  8. Various drinks. \hfill \break 

Like the rays of the sun, the butter of milk, the burning of fire, the stupor of poison, the sesame oil from the sesame seed, the shade from the tree, the sweet odor from a fruit, the fire from a scabbard, the sweet sap of Śārkara\footnote{A liquor prepared from Dhātakī with sugar.} and so on, the cold of piles of snow, and so on is the inherent essence of things. In the same way, the course of the world is also in the center of the highest God's own form. And the Most High God is indivisible and all-filling.

The root-container is the second [one]. The heel of the backfoot is caused to be placed at the root of the big toe. As a result the fire is strengthened. One heel is caused to be placed at the Root-container. The heel of the other foot is caused to be placed at the root of the big toe of this foot. The fire of it is caused to be kindled. The third is the place of the anus-container. From the execution of expansion and contraction a stable vitalwind arises. Additionally death of the person does not arise. Additionally the person does not die. The fourth is the penis-container. Due to the execution of repeated practice of contracting the penis in the midst of therof, the adamantine channel appears in the middle of the staff of the back. From the repeated practice again [and again] the transition of both breath and mind into its center arises. Caused by the transition of them both into the center the trinity of knots breaks. There, from the breaking of that, the vitalwind after having filled up (the central channel?) resides in the center of the Brahma-lotus. Then virility and strength arises. The person becomes youthful forever. The fifth is Udyāna. From performing \textit{bandha} there, urine and faeces disappear. The sixth is the navel-container. From repeated practice of \textit{praṇava}, the unstruck sound arises by itself. The seventh is the container of the heart-form. The throat-support is the eighth. There the contraction of Jālaṃdhara is produced. While abiding therein the vitalwind in the Iḍā-and Piṅgalā-channels becomes stable. The ninth is the container of the uvula. There, the tip of the tongue becomes attached [to the uvula]. Then the nectar of immortality flows from the immortality-digit. From drinking the nectar of immortality diseases do not spread in the body. The tenth is the container of the palate. After the moving and milking has been done therein while abiding at the door of the uvula, the tongue resides inserted within the palate. The eleventh is the tongue-container at the surface of the tongue. Within it the tip of the tongue has to be churned. While doing [that] a sweet drink flows out. And in that manner the knowledge of areas like poetry, singing, metric and dance is generated. On top thereof is the twelfth, being the teeth-support, which is situated inbetween the teeth. At this place the tip of the tongue is to be positioned with force for the duration of one and a half \textit{ghāṭī}s (24+12 = 36 minutes). Abiding therein the diseases of the practitioner will entirely disappear! The thirteenth is the nose-container. While making it into the fixation object the mind becomes stable. The fourteenth is the container of breath at the root of the nose. From the execution of stabilizing of the gaze onto this, the light of one's own becomes perceptible within 60 months. He breaks the mundane prison through the perceptibility of the light. The fifteenth container is situated in the middle of the eyebrows. Due to stabilizing the gaze therein 10 million rays of light sparkle. The sixteenth is the eye-container. Without wavering, the gaze [ayam] is to be held at the tip of the finger without wavering. From practicing this on earth any energy exists [for him]. The light of everything that is arises as the object of sight. From that sight the person becomes omniscient.
